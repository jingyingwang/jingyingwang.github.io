On Monday, May 20, 2024, I graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in Mathematics and English, with Distinction in the English major. I was awarded the GALA Senior Prize for a graduating senior whose essay is judged to be most relevant to gay and lesbian issues. I won the Academy of American Poets Prize for the best poem or group of poems by an outstanding senior student in English, and I was also awarded the Jonathan Edwards College Creative Writing Prize for the senior who has written an outstanding piece of creative writing for my long poem, *Homily*. 

I am infinitely grateful for the intellectual rigor my two majors afforded me, and I was glad to conclude my coursework with a senior essay in English titled "Becoming-Crocodile: Kinships, Worldmaking, and a Genealogy of Possible Lives / An Existentialist Reading of *Notes of a Crocodile*" and a senior project in Mathematics on the irreducible representations of symmetric groups and the ring of symmetric functions. After graduation, I will be moving to NYC in June and start a full time job in September. Over the summer I will be interning part-time for an educational nonprofit, and I'm hoping to spend some time writing, pitching, and building a literary community in the city. here's to more math and english...
