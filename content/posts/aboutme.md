* yale '24, B. A. Mathematics and English 
* 🏠 from suzhou, china
* 📍 nyc

I am interested in solving problems and creating beautiful things. 

At Yale, I was President of the [Yale Political Union](https://ypu.sites.yale.edu/), Opinion Editor and President of the Editorial Board at [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/author/jeanwang/), and Curatorial Assistant at the [YLS Law Library]([url](https://library.law.yale.edu/)). I also dabbled in [radio](https://wybc.com/) and [quantum computing research]([url](https://yaleqc.com/)). I studied abroad at Cambridge University and interned at [D. E. Shaw Investment Management](https://www.deshaw.com/). 

My senior essay in English was titled "Kinships, Worldmaking, and a Genealogy of Possible Lives: An Existentialist Reading of *Notes of a Crocodile*", and my senior project in Mathematics was on the irreducible representations of symmetric groups and the ring of symmetric functions. 

Outside of my majors, I've taken courses on probabilistic machine learning,  existentialism, from manuscript research to quantum computing, from abstract algebra to Kant and Hegel. I also accelerated my degree and graduated a semester early.
