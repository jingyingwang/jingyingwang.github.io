**what did you do at yale, jean**
  
At Yale, I was President of the [Yale Political Union](https://ypu.sites.yale.edu/), Opinion Editor and President of the Editorial Board at [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/author/jeanwang/), and Curatorial Assistant at the [YLS Law Library]([url](https://library.law.yale.edu/)). I also dabbled in [radio](https://wybc.com/) and [quantum computing research]([url](https://yaleqc.com/)). I researched [international security]([url](https://thecsi.org.uk/international-security-and-intelligence-isi-programme/)) at Cambridge University and interned at [D. E. Shaw Investment Management](https://www.deshaw.com/). 

My senior essay in English was titled "Kinships, Worldmaking, and a Genealogy of Possible Lives: An Existentialist Reading of *Notes of a Crocodile*", and my senior project in Mathematics was on the irreducible representations of symmetric groups and the ring of symmetric functions. Outside of my majors, I've taken courses on probabilistic machine learning, quantum computing, existentialism, manuscript & archival research, Kant, and Hegel. I graduated with Distinction in the English major.
